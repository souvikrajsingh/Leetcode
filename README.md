# Leetcode

I humbly acknowledge that I haven't been consistent in my practice of Data Structures and Algorithm problem solving for the past few months. Regrettably, I have realized the importance of maintaining a regular schedule and dedicating time to hone my skills in this area. In order to rectify my shortcomings, I have made a firm commitment to solve LeetCode questions consistently on a daily basis, starting from now. I believe that by adhering to this practice, I will not only improve my problem-solving abilities but also enhance my chances of success in future interviews.

In an effort to share my progress and hold myself accountable, I have initiated a blogging series on Hashnode, where I will document and discuss the significant algorithmic challenges that I encounter during my preparation. Through this endeavor, I aim to embrace a growth mindset and cultivate a strong foundation in algorithms for my professional journey ahead.

<br/>In this series I will be sharing with you the most asked algorithms in Google, Microsoft or any of the MAANG companies. This will not only help me understand them better but also help some of you :) <br/>
